**weather application using Maui App**

I developed a mobile weather application using the Maui App framework. This app retrieves weather information from the https://open-meteo.com API. 
The app allows users to search for a city by name and displays detailed weather information for that city,
including current weather conditions, wind speed, temperature, and a seven-day weather forecast.


This weather app built with Maui App provides a user-friendly interface for accessing vital weather data,
making it convenient for users to stay informed about the weather conditions in their desired locations.


The application leverages the power of the Maui App framework to deliver a seamless user experience across various mobile devices.
By combining functionality with a visually appealing design,
this weather app aims to provide users with a comprehensive tool for staying updated on weather forecasts.


I am excited to share this weather application on GitHub, along with its source code,
allowing others to explore and potentially contribute to its development.
Feel free to explore the app's functionalities and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Happy coding! 


To properly display animated weather images such as rain, snow, etc.,
users need to download them and place them in the "row" folder within the app directory.
